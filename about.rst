I'm Calvin. My interests are in Bayesian machine learning (deep and "shallow"), functional programming, and mathematics. In my past life, I was a PhD student at Indiana University studying algebraic topology and homotopy theory. This background gave me a natural interest in statically-typed languages and category theory, but I haven't been able to find a way to combine with my day job yet.
