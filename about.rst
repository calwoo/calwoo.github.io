title: About

I'm Calvin. My interests are in Bayesian machine learning (deep and "shallow"), functional programming, and mathematics. In my past life, I was a PhD student at Indiana University studying algebraic topology and homotopy theory. This background gave me a natural interest in statically-typed languages and category theory, but I haven't been able to find a way to combine them with my day job yet.

This site is built on Hakyll and is deployed automatically with CircleCI. I recommend anyone who doesn't know how these tools work to try it out-- it'll take several hours if you don't know what you're doing, but you will learn so much from it (as I did).
