title: Initial post

This is the first post to my blog. I'm hoping that I will go at this for awhile, but I hope to
keep this as a sort of continual notebook/record of my learnings as time goes on. As a former
academic, I'm used to using pen and paper to write notes, but since I use a keyboard more often
than I write nowadays, my handwriting skills have seriously deteriorated.

My first couple of posts will probably be about profunctors and traversals in Haskell, and then
I might pivot towards topics in machine learning, along with some random math thrown in there.

Let's take it a step at a time.
